# Sawyer_Baldwin_Portfolio

This is a portfolio website intrended to display biographical information and a miriad of work from Sawyer Baldwin.

## Description
This website was created with the knolege of HTML and CSS that I gained so far in this coding bootcamp. The largest factors of success through my own eyes is the implementation of psuedo code, media queries, and proper useage of flex properties. Up to this point, these skills have proved to be the most challenging.

## Usage
This webpage was created to showcase the work of Sawyer Baldwin and provide a biography for prospective future employers to view and analyze. This page will continue to grow with challenges and projects over the course of the next six months. Right now it only shows work with HTML and CSS, but this will expand into other areas in the comming weeks.

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* Sharpened skills in HTML to improve my alt tags on images and how to properly link to web pages and pdf's.

* I gained more understanding of CSS through research and review of class materials.

* I gained a better understanding of flex properties and how they work with various elements.
